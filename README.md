# Simple Book CRUD App

This is a simple Book CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using TypeScript. It allows users to add, edit, and delete books. The books are stored in an in-memory data store.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

### Add Book

To add a new book, enter the title and author in the respective input fields and click the "Add" button.

### Edit Book

To edit a book, click the "Edit" button next to the book you want to modify. A prompt will appear, allowing you to enter a new title and author for the book.

### Delete Book

To delete a book, click the "Delete" button next to the book you want to remove from the list.

## Code Structure

The application consists of three files:

1. `index.html`: The HTML file that defines the user interface of the application.

2. `app.ts`: The TypeScript file containing the main logic and functions for the Book CRUD operations.

3. `app.js`: The JavaScript file generated from the TypeScript code.
